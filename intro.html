            <h2>Photovoltaic system</h2>
            <p>Photovoltaic (PV) systems are innovative energy solutions that convert sunlight into electricity using solar panels. Essentially, they capture the sun's energy and transform it into usable power for homes, businesses, and beyond. By harnessing this renewable resource, PV systems offer a sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources, reducing carbon emissions and reliance on non-renewable fuels. In simple terms, think of PV systems as solar panels that turn sunlight into electricity, providing clean and eco-friendly power for various applications.</p>

          <h2>What Are The Components Of A Solar Photovoltaic System?</h2>
    
          <div class="content-wrapper">
            <ul>
                <li>Solar PV modules:catch light, or more particularly, photons from the sun, and transform their energy into usable power via a process known as the photovoltaic effect. </li>
                <li>Module Mounting Structure:will be installed on permanent iron structures of sufficient strength and design to handle module loads and strong wind speeds.</li>
                <li>Inverter:absorbs direct current (DC) and transforms it to alternating current (AC)</li>
                <li>Battery Bank:A battery bank ensures that no excess energy is wasted by storing the energy produced by the PV array and not immediately consuming it</li>
                <li>Ac & DC Cables and accessories</li>

              </ul>
